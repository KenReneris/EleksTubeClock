# EleksTubeClock

Startup:
    - Make a connector as shown in doc_images and replace the elekstube board.
    - Compile and flash the sketch into the ESP8266.
    - On power on all the digits should squence.

Initial power on:
    - Use your phone and look for the "EleksTube" wifi and connec to it.
    - Type in your home wifi name and password.
    - When the clock connects to the network it will display the last value or two of it's IP address.
  > * All settings for the clock are down via the Web Server interface 
        - Note the "s" command on the serial port console will show WiFi IP as well.

    On connecting to the local WiFi the clock will contact an NTP server and start showing gmt time.

To set the timezone:
    - Connect to the device.  E.g. http://192.168.0.XX
    - Goto to More -> Timezone
    - Either enter your current date & time (manual)
  > * Or switch to automatic:
        - goto https://timezonedb.com/ and register for an API key
        - enter the key into the form and press submit

Non-time display:
    Occasionaly the display will display something other then the time or date:
    - all 0s    Soft AP started
    - all 1s    Trying to connect to local network
    - all 2s    WiFi Connection lost
    - all 3s    WiFi Disconnected
    - all 6s    WiFi Connection failed
    - last values of local IP address being used (white)
    - time turns red brielfy.. WiFi is online but there was a NTP or TZ sync error

Web Settings:
    - 12 or 24 hour mode
    - settable schedule for time being displayed
    - settable schedule for display being dimmed
    - top of hour effect
    - quarter of hour effect
    - periodic display date effect
    - ntp sync rate
    - timezone sync or manual adjust
    - enabled/disable microadjust
    - optional password
    
    - Settable Highlighting Effects:
        - User supplied color
        - Disabled. (Same as "No effect" for "0" seconds)
        - No effect. Display value for 0 to 15 seconds
        - Cross Fade value in and out.  Hold value for 0 to 15 seconds
        - Blend value in and out.  Hold value for 0 to 15 seconds
        - Display value for 0 to 15 seconds, Blend value out
        - Flash value 0 to 15 times

Microadjust:
    This feature is under test.  It averages the drift of the ESP8266 crystal as compared to the NTP time
    and makes a small adjustment to the rate of time being in order to reduce the time error.  This is 
    probably not really needed if the clock is connected full time to wifi. (on eveyr wifi ntp sync there would
    be a fraction of a second being set).  The purpose of the feature is that I have one of these clocks at
    work and it can't stay connected to WiFi.  So once in a while I will let it sync NTP via my phone and in
    the interim this adjustment will keep it reasonable accurate.

    /time                   - returns the current time
    /forceon?s={seconds}    - if s > 0, forces time-on for # of seconds.  if s < 0, forces time-off for # seconds
    /forcedim?s={seconds}   - if s > 0, forces dim-on for # of seconds. if s < 0, forces dim-off for # of seconds
    /popup?d={digits}?e={effect}&h={hold/count}&c={color}
        - use the /TestPopup.html page to get examples on how to form the popup url
        - note popup will appear even if the time display has been turned off
