The <a href='https://www.banggood.com/EleksMaker-EleksTube-Bamboo-6-Bit-Kit-Time-Electronic-Glow-Tube-Clock-Time-Flies-Lapse-p-1297292.html'>EleksTube</a> clock from <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/938509544/elekstube-a-time-machine'>Kickstarter</a> brings RGB addressable LEDs in a Nixie tube format powered by a USB source. 
This project replaces the controller that comes with the clock with an <a href='https://www.esp8266.com'>ESP8266</a> that syncs the time to an NTP time source over wifi, and includes a small webserver for configuration.
